# Task 3: Review Summary

# Implement a function that takes the first 30 characters of a review and appends "â€¦" to create a summary. (Bonus) Ensure that the summary does not cut off in the middle of a word.

python_reviews = [ "This product is really good. I'm impressed with its quality.", "The performance of this product is excellent. Highly recommended!", "I had a bad experience with this product. It didn't meet my expectations.", "This was a poor quality product. Wouldn't recommend it to anyone.", "The product was average. Nothing extraordinary about it." ]

# look at each review individually
# slpit each review into a list of words 
# iterate through thatv list and add each word to my summary while also counting the length of each word untill I get to at least thirty
